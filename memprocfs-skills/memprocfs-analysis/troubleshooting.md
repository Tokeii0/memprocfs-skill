# MemProcFS Skill Troubleshooting

This guide helps resolve common issues you might encounter when using the MemProcFS Assistant Skill.

## Issue: Skill Not Triggering

If the Skill doesn't activate when you ask a relevant question, try the following:

1.  **Be More Specific**: Use keywords from the Skill's description. Instead of "look at this memory dump," try "analyze the memory dump at..." or "start a forensic investigation on this image."
2.  **Check Skill Availability**: Ask "What Skills are available?" to ensure the `memprocfs-assistant` Skill is loaded correctly.
3.  **Restart Claude Code**: If the Skill was recently added, you might need to restart the application to load it.

## Issue: MemProcFS Errors

If you encounter errors reported by MemProcFS itself, consider these common causes:

1.  **Invalid Memory Dump Path**: Ensure the path to the memory dump file is correct and accessible from the environment where MemProcFS is running.
2.  **Driver Issues**: For live memory analysis, ensure the required drivers (e.g., WinPMEM, Dokany) are installed and loaded correctly.
3.  **Permissions**: MemProcFS may require administrator or root privileges to access certain system resources, especially for live analysis.
4.  **Corrupted Memory Image**: The memory dump file might be corrupted or incomplete. Try re-acquiring the image if possible.

## Issue: Python API Script Fails

If a Python script generated by the Skill fails, check the following:

1.  **`memprocfs` Package**: Make sure the `memprocfs` Python package is installed in the correct environment (`pip install memprocfs`).
2.  **VMM Initialization**: Verify that the arguments passed to `memprocfs.Vmm([...])` are correct for your setup (e.g., correct device type and path).
3.  **Object Existence**: The script might be trying to access a process or file that doesn't exist in the memory image. Add checks to ensure objects are not `None` before using them.

## General Tips

-   **Verbosity**: When running MemProcFS from the command line, use the `-v` (verbose) or `-vv` (very verbose) flags to get more detailed output, which can help diagnose issues.
-   **Check the Wiki**: The official [MemProcFS Wiki](https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS/wiki) is an excellent resource for detailed documentation and advanced usage.
